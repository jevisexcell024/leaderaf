            <p>This initiative was birthed out of the need to enhance the overall learning capabilities amongst young
                people in socio-economically deprived communities across Ghana. There is a huge margin of young
                individuals in deprived urban or rural communities who never realize their full potential to achieve
                success academically, socially and professionally. This is due to they being unaware of their innate
                capabilities to be great and their ignorance about the uniqueness of their person.</p>
<div class="image-future">

</div>

<p>We strongly believe that this world is a big puzzle, and every individual possesses the uniqueness to be a part of that puzzle to make the world whole. This is why we have different intelligence types, different learning types, different interests and different paths to achieving same greatness.</p>
<p>The sad bit of this fact is that, young children mostly in deprived communities are not privy to this realization. This tends to affect their approach to academics, career and life choices in general. This is why LeadAfrique International has come up with a carefully designed programme dubbed “Learning2learn”. This programme has specific modules that assists young individuals to become aware of their self, better organize their daily activities with clearly defined priorities, portray a better persona to their network of people, voluntarily lead discussions and projects in school and their communities and make well informed career choices that reflects their identity and purpose on earth.</p>
