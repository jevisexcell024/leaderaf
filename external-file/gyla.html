            <p>The Ghana Youth Leadership Academy was an academy organized by LeadAfrique International with backing
                from the Centre Party, Sweden. The academy was organized to groom young and upcoming leaders to become a
                better version of themselves. The academy was hosted at Ensign Health College. In attendance were 40
                youth leaders spanning several organizations, unions, political parties, and activists.</p>

<div class="gyla-img"></div>
<p>The duration of the opening camp was a week and the activities to be done were structured into 7 days.</p>
<p>On Saturday 26 th of March, the enlisted participants converged at the Accra Mall and were driven to Ensign Health College, on arrival, rooms were allocated to participants and the first activity took place. The first activity was to know each other, be familiar with one another, break the ice in the room and make everyone feel comfortable around each other.</p>
<div class="gyla-img"></div>
       <p>A workbook was given to each participant to track their understanding of concepts to be taught and activities to be done at the Academy. On day 1, participants were taken through two exercises,</p>
       <p>The Objective Ball Exercise, and The Amazing Race under the tutelage of Michael Ohene-Effah. The exercises shed light on the benefit of playing together as a team and complementing one another, it also highlighted how to make good use of scarce resources by looking around them and finding solutions to their problems from around and within them.</p>
       <p>A discussion on the Development of Africa was also held, and participants were made to rack up their brains and find the causes and solutions concerning the stunted developmental growth that Africa is facing.</p>
